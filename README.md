# Menu_Organizer
This is the Menu Organizer that I a began building as a capstone project for the Web App Development course. Since then, I have expanded upon various functionalities to manage and allow users to place orders for my lunch business. Currently, students can log and order their desired menu item using this web app online via the heroku service: https://min-munches-lunch-order-app.herokuapp.com/

I can view, edit, and manage the menu, announcements, settings, users, history, and orders at once through this application. 

The web app is constantly being updated with new additions and changes based on feedback I am receiving from my peers and other users.
